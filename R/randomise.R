#' Randomised group of items
#'
#' Set a randomised group of items for crowdsourcing citizen science.
#' Generate designs for ranking of options. It is designed for tricot trials 
#' specifically (comparing 3 options), but it will also work with comparisons 
#' of any other number of options. 
#' The design strives for approximate A optimality, this means that it is robust 
#' to missing observations. It also strives for balance for positions of each option.
#' Options are equally divided between first, second, third, etc. position. 
#' The strategy is to create a "pool" of combinations that does not repeat 
#' combinations and is A-optimal. Then this pool is ordered to make subsets of 
#' consecutive combinations also relatively balanced and A-optimal
