# ClimMobTools


## Overview

The **ClimMobTools** repository provides the toolkit employed in crowdsourcing citizen science projects under the *tricot* approach. Tricot, stands for "triadic comparison of technologies", an approach developed by [Bioversity International](https://www.bioversityinternational.org/) for the rapid assessment of on-farm evaluation trails in small-scale agriculture[@VanEtten2016]. 

To create your project, please visit the [ClimMob](https://climmob.net/blog/) portal. 

### Methodological approach

In the *tricot* approach, each participant receives a set of technologies (generally three) randomly allocated as incomplete blocks from a larger set. It maintains spatial balance by assigning roughly equal frequencies of the varieties to each area. The trials required three moments of contact with the participants: (*i*) explaining the experiment and distributing the trial technologies, (*ii*) collecting evaluation data, and (*iii*) returning the results[@VanEtten2016].

Participants’ independent observations are compiled and analysed centrally. A simple ranking-based feedback format allows even participants with low literacy skills to contribute their evaluation data through various channels, including mobile telephones.

### Statistical approach

For the data analysis, ClimMob employs the Plackett–Luce model with the R package `PlackettLuce`[@Turner2018]. The `PlackettLuce` package implements a generalization of the model jointly 
attributed to Plackett (1975)[@Plackett1975] and Luce (1959)[@Luce1959] for modelling rankings data. The Plackett–Luce model estimates for each tested technology the probability that it wins, beating all others in the set. 


### Evidence on the tricot approach 

Current evidence has demonstrated that: (*i*) the tricot approach engage motivated participants as citizen scientists[@Beza2017]; (*ii*) the data generated by citizen scientists is reliable and can produce meaningful results for agricultural research[@Steinke2017]; (*iii*) the approach can engage farmers into the discussion for the future of local, sustainable plant breeding efforts[@Mancini2017]; (*iv*) addresses the challenge of variety replacement for climate adaptation in a way that is, at the same time, scalable and demand led[@VanEtten2019].
