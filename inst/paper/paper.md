# Summary

Abiotic factors play an important role in most ecological and crop systems that depend on certain levels of temperature, light and precipitation to initiate important physiological events [@PlantEcology]. Understanding how these factors drive the physiological processes is a key approach to provide recommendations for adaptation and biodiversity conservation in applied ecology studies. The package `climatrends` aims to provide the methods in R [@RCoreTeam] to compute precipitation and temperature indices that serve as input for climate and crop models [@vanEtten2019; @Kehel2016], trends in climate change [@Aguilar2005; @deSousa2018] and applied ecology [@Prentice1992; @YLiu2018].

# Statement of need

Reproducibility, the ability to repeat the analysis, and replicability, the ability to repeat an experiment [@Stevens2017], are key to performing collaborative scientific research [@Powers2019; @Munafo2017]. It allows scientists to re-perform analysis after a long hiatus and peers to validate analysis and get new insights using original or new data. This is still a gap in most of the studies in agriculture and ecology. `climatrends` addresses this specific issue. The package originates from a set of scripts to compute climate indices in our previous studies [@deSousa2018; @vanEtten2019]. Building up on the interest in expanding the analysis to other regions and to enable reproducible and replicable studies among different research groups within the CGIAR (https://www.cgiar.org) and partner institutions we developed `climatrends`. Most of the package functions take into account the heterogeneity of testing sites (locations), dates and seasons, a common characteristic of decentralized agricultural trials [@vanEtten2019].
